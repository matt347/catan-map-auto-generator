This code will generate FAIR catan boards that have even number distributions, resource spreads, general randomess, and more.
This code can generate endless perfect catan maps that you have never seen before but only works on the standard catan board.

You can also currently tweak parameters so that the desert is uncentered and change number spreads.

To run the program, simply use the set parameters in CatanMapGenerator.py and hit run. You will have a board generated in seconds.
It is important to note however, sometimes the program will fail in making a board due to randomness being uncertain. It is unlikely
to happen during any run you attempt but if it does fail, simply rerun the program as many times as needed to get a board. There is a
low probability, that if at all, you will need to rerun more than once to generate an output.

In the future, this code will work on more catan board variants, and looking at the code you will see some of those features in place but unfinished.
If there are any issues, contact me! Hope you enjoy this program as much as I have.
